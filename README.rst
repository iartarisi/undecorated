Quickstart
``````````

Install:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install undecorated

Try it on one of your functions:

.. code:: python

   >>> from undecorated import undecorated
   >>> undecorated(my_decorated_function)
   <function my_decorated_function at 0x7fbdd6e95938>

`undecorated` has returned your original function clean of any decorators.


It also works with class decorators!


Example
```````

.. code:: python

    >>> from functools import wraps
    >>> from undecorated import undecorated
    >>>
    >>> def decorate_with(*decorations):
    ...     def decorator(f):
    ...         @wraps(f)
    ...         def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    ...             print decorations
    ...             return f(*args, **kwargs)
    ...         return wrapper
    ...     return decorator
    ... 
    >>> @decorate_with('yellow_bauble')
    ... @decorate_with('red_bauble')
    ... @decorate_with('tinsel')
    ... def tree():
    ...     print 'tree'
    ... 
    >>> tree()
    ('yellow_bauble',)
    ('red_bauble',)
    ('tinsel',)
    tree
    >>> undecorated(tree)()
    tree
